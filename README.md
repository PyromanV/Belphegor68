# Belphegor68
Project Belphegor, aka Belphegor68 is a completely 3D-printable DIY mechanical keyboard. The objective of this repository is to provide documentation, give access to production files, models and build instructions to anyone interested.

Originally, this was a project for me to learn KiCad while doing something useful, so this is not a professional design and I provide no warranty of any sort. Everything you do you are doing at your own responsibility.
